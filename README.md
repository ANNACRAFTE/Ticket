# Discord Tickets hosting on Railway

You can host Discord Tickets bot on Railway for free without credit card! On railway you get $5 credit monthly for free (more info about their pricing [here](https://railway.app/pricing)). If you use your free credit, your projects will be paused and you need to re-deploy them next month when you get credit. You can also upgrade to Developer plan by adding your credit card details (you will be billed only when your usage is more than $10). You don't have to add your credit card tho. Railway offers MySQL plugin so you don't need to worry about database.
Just follow this guide.
